# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)


# q = ['man', 'woamn', 'gold', 'silver', 'bronse', 'tumbler', 'gee']

# q.each do |x|
#   Category.create(name: x)
# end
